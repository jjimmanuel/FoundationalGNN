Code that builds a GNN that can be pre-trained for molecular representation via node feature and edge feature masking. The Masker class also includes logic that masks edge indices, but this logic is not carried forward to the model or to the loss calculatoins. When looking to build a GNN for pre-training, I had found that it was difficult to find lots of code examples online, especially with respect to masking strategies. I hope that this code, in particular the masking strategies employed here, are useful to those looking to pre-train a GNN within any field. Built using PyTorch Geometric. Updates will be made over time.
