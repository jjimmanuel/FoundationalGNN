Code that builds a GNN that can be pre-trained for molecular representation via node feature and edge feature masking. The Masker class also includes logic that masks edge indices, but this logic is not carried forward to the model or to the loss calculatoins. When looking to build a GNN for pre-training, I had found that it was difficult to find lots of code examples online, especially with respect to masking strategies. Although there are plenty of research papers around the topic, I sometimes had a hard time finding the code that they used. I hope that this code, in particular the masking strategies employed here, are useful to those looking to pre-train a GNN regardless of the field of work. This was built using PyTorch Geometric. As such, the Masker class requires a PyTorch Dataset as an input. Updates will be made over time. I would note that the Loss.py script is currently just a generic loss calculation between the predicted tensor and the masked tensor. I need to make additional changes to ensure that loss is calculated between the batched masked tensor and the batched unmasked tensor -- masked and predicted vs orig and unmasked.
